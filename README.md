# Card Game

This is a simple card game called War.


The goal of War is to have two players compete against each other. They are each dealt 26 cards (half of a full deck) and they play the cards one at a time. The person with the higher card (Ace being the highest) wins that hand. For this version of the game, ties will be allowed to happen, and the player's decks will not be reshuffled. As such, the game is over once all of the cards have been played, and the winner is whomever won the most hands.
